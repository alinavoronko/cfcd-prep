# API Endpoints

The Cloud Foundry API is a RESTful interface exposed by the Cloud Controller. You may hear this API referred to as `CAPI`, an abbreviation for the `Cloud Controller API`. The Cloud Controller API is also part of the **common core**, meaning it is standard across the different vendor distributions.

When you set an API endpoint, you are selecting a deployment of Cloud Foundry to use. You may hear some vendors refer to deployments as "foundations" or "instances", but they are essentially one and the same. They are a running Cloud Foundry deployment.
